Six checks, every submission. Miss one and it comes back with notes; fix it and
resubmit. Nothing here is a judgement call about whether your project is
impressive — these are the things that are either true or not.

## Replaces something proprietary

It stands in for something people pay for, or something closed you'd rather have
open. **Name it in your project description.** A reviewer shouldn't have to guess
which subscription this is aimed at.

Hardware counts, as long as it's beneficial to a homelab or on-prem setup — even
indirectly. An antenna that pulls in public radio channels and streams them is a
CloudFall project.

## Built new, during this round

No resubmitting a project from another YSWS, and no bringing hours with it. A
project you started earlier can inspire this one; it can't *be* this one.

## Hours tracked

Every hour in Hackatime, linked to the project you submit. Untracked time can't
be counted, and at most 30% of the work can be AI-assisted.

## Open source, permanently

- Public GitHub repo.
- A permissive licence, as a `LICENSE` file.
- A README with images.
- It stays up. Deleting the repo after review is not how this works.

## It runs

A live link a reviewer can open and use. If it's self-hosted only, ship a repo
and a Docker container so the reviewer can start it themselves. See
[Package it so it runs](/cloudfall/packaging).

## It's your own work

Not a tutorial followed step for step. Not somebody else's project with the
colours changed. Using libraries, base images and other people's Compose files is
normal engineering — passing off someone else's project as yours is not.

## If it comes back

You'll get notes naming the specific check that failed. Fix that thing and
resubmit; there's no penalty for a resubmission. If the notes don't make sense,
ask in **#ysws-cloudfall** — reviewers are in there, and "I don't understand this
note" is a completely reasonable message.
