/**
 * One brand seed → every color on the page, in OKLCH.
 *
 * The shared shadcn-shaped tokens (--background, --card, --primary, …) are
 * generated with the same formulas stern uses in lib/theme-palette.ts, on
 * purpose: when these docs are framed inside a program's stern pages the two
 * surfaces have to look like one product, and matching the *algorithm* keeps
 * them agreeing even after either side changes its brand color.
 *
 * On top of that sit the tokens only the docs need  the panel/hairline/LED
 * language of the sidebar and header. Those are derived from the same seed hue,
 * so a program's docs feel like its own equipment rather than a grey chrome
 * with a colored button in it.
 *
 * **Light only.** There is deliberately no dark variant and no appearance
 * switch: one surface per program means one set of contrast decisions to get
 * right, and an embed inherits its host's page rather than negotiating with it.
 *
 * Pure and deterministic: the server renders these into a <style> tag and
 * nothing recomputes them client-side.
